["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface At the SportsMechanist our mission is to provide coaches and athletes with valuable information, taking the guess-work out of decision making. A biomechanical analysis aims to help coaches and athletes optimize: Technique Physique Biomechanical reports offer objective markers to scale athletes’ strengths and weaknesses, using laws of mechanics. It’s up to the coach to embrace the general trends derived from large number of subjects and draw a career progression taking in account the unique traits that each sprinter has. Our aim is to bridge the gap between the elaborate reasearch-grade motion capture analysis and the static app-based analysis. Motion capture systems are the gold standard when it comes to kinematic analysis. However, they have obvious drawbacks, namely that they require a lot of work to set up. This has meant that cyclic sports (e.g. running, cycling) have been favoured in research as they can be performed on the spot using treadmills. Acyclic sports on the other hand have been largely neglected in research despite their obvious higher motor requirements. We wish to make kinematic analysis available to acyclic sports. Using state-of-the-art video tracking software based on deep learning algorithms, we are able to perform automatic markerless tracking. This coupled with our utilizing the best available data science software for analysis, we generate tailored biomechanical reports. "],
["triple-jump.html", "1 Triple Jump", " 1 Triple Jump The triple jump is one of the most demanding sporting disciplines. It consists of three consecutive jumps: a hop, step and jump. The peak ground reaction forces are the highest recorded in any human movement, reaching upwards of 21 times bodyweight in the step [1]. On top of this, the athlete still has another take-off left. That is why proper technical execution is imperative to a succesful triple jump. Here we will provide a short overview of the most important biomechanical aspects of the triple jump. Over the years, some research into the biomechanics of the triple jump has been done, mostly during the 80’s and 90’s. In addition to these there has been published a number of biomechanical reports from various World Championships over the years [2–5] which provides reference values for world class performances. This body of research has been directed in a number of directions: Phase ratio [6–9] Velocities [10–12] Take-off leg mechanics [1, 12–16] Free limb mechanics [17, 18] Balance Gender differences Along with each section, we define a set of Key performance indicators (KPIs). KPIs are the most important variables predicting performance. These differ from sport to sport, and not all are intuitive. At the SportsMechanist we’ve selected the most appropriate KPIs based on scientific literature and biomechanical reports from World Championships. "],
["phase-ratio.html", "1.1 Phase ratio", " 1.1 Phase ratio The phase ratio is the length of each phase relative to the total length of the triple jump (e.g. 35%, 30%, 35%). Three techniques have been described [19]: Hop-dominant: the hop distance is at least 2% greater than the next largest phase distance. Jump-dominant: the jump distance is at least 2% greater than the next largest phase distance. Balanced: the longest phase distance is less than 2% greater than the next largest phase distance. As most variables change with technique, this is the first step of an analysis and results should be viewed in light of the technique [19]. Whereas the hop-dominant technique used to be favoured, in recent years athletes have transitioned to more balanced and jump-dominant techniques [5, 19]. Trying to determine the optimal phase ratio has received much scientific attention. It has been suggested that an optimal phase ratio could be dependent on strength levels or the ability to convert horizontal velocity to vertical velocity [6, 20, 21]. Although no single optimal distribution has been found, a conservative picture emerges that no phase should exceed 39% or be less than 27% approximately.

["velocities.html", "1.2 Velocities", " 1.2 Velocities Horizontal velocity. It has repeatedly been established that the single best predictor of performance is the horizontal velocity in the run-up, as up to 94% of the results can be attributed to run-up velocity [10–12]. Interestingly, run-up horizontal velocity is a better predictor of performance than horizontal velocity at take-off [10]. This is potentially because the run-up velocity determines the amount of mechanical energy the athlete will be able to produce in the take-off [12]. Vertical velocity. Vertical velocities… Take-off angle. The take-off angle is the product of the horizontal and vertical take-off velocity, and as such is determined by the combination. The take-off angle is typically highest in the jump, however this naturally differ with technique. Thus, hop-dominant jumpers tend to reach higher take-off angles in the hop and jump-dominant jumpers reach higher angles in the jump. Velocity conversion. At each take-off vertical velocity is produced at the expense of horizontal velocity. How well a jumper performs this velocity conversion (minimise the loss of horizontal velocity) has been speculated to influence the optimal phase ratio [9, 21]. Table 1.2: Velocities KPIs Variable Description Horizontal velocity Horizontal velocity at take-off for the hop, step and jump in m/s Vertical velocity Vertical velocity at take-off for the hop, step and jump in m/s Velocity conversion Velocity conversion Take-off angle Take-off angle relative to horizontal "],
["take-off-leg-mechanics.html", "1.3 Take-off leg mechanics", " 1.3 Take-off leg mechanics Active landing, pawing, horizontal velocity of foot, etc. [22] Contact times are often reported, however they are a double edged sword. Shorter contact times are correlated with longer jumps, however the relationship is not as straightforward as that. Contact times in the triple jump is mainly thought to be a consequence of horizontal velocity. The faster the velocity, the shorter time the jumper has on the ground before having to take-off again. So what seems a correlation between contact times and result is in fact correlation between horizontal velocity and result. Indeed, it is the target for the jumper to exert the greatest amount of force (impulse) on the ground, and following the impulse equation \\(F*t=m*v\\) either increasing the amount of force OR time will increase the velocity of the jumper. As noted by [19], the consequence is that shorter contact times alone are not desirable.

["free-limb-mechanics.html", "1.4 Free limb mechanics", " 1.4 Free limb mechanics Arm swing. The free limbs are considered to be the arms and the leg not touching the ground during a contact phase. Especially the arm swing has been the subject of much attention. Yu and Andrews [17] found that the arm swing contributes mainly in increasing the vertical velocity and possibly in maintaining balance (definition by [1]), whilst decreasing horizontal velocity. However, there exists different arm swing techniques - a topic which has almost not been investigated. The different types of arm swings are: 1) The single arm, 2) the double arm and 3) the arm-and-a-half technique. These have all been utilized at world-class level and have been combined in different ways (e.g. hop:single arm, step:double arm, jump:double arm). A modelling experiment has suggested that the double-arm swing is benefitial [18], however more work needs to be done before conclusions can be drawn. It is interesting though, that almost all finalists in the 2017 World Championships, nearly all male triple jumpers employed a double-arm swing, whereas all females used a single-arm technique.

["balance.html", "1.5 Balance", " 1.5 Balance Balance is a concept familiar to most coaches, however the biomechanical definition is less clear. Hay [1] describes it as such: “Balance is a state in which the angular impulse exerted about each of the principal axes of a human body is consistent with the change in angular momentum required about that axis.” This statement tells us that angular momentum is at the center of balance. And although.. Many coaches emphasize the importance of upright posture and trunk angle is also reported in WC biomechanical analyses [2, 4, 5]. So although there are no scientific reports regarding trunk angles, we have included these in our report.

Quite a bit of velocity is lost in the step. The vertical velocities are very reasonable, almost comparable to those achieved at world-class level [6], with the exception of the jump which is not high. It is apparent from the take-off angles that the step is probably too high (with a big loss of horizontal velocity), whereas the jump becomes too shallow. "],

In the graphs we’re looking at the negative velocities during support, and neither peak or mean velocities are nowhere near what the were during the hop or step. The performance during hop and step are on level with world-class athletes. Taken together with the fact that the swing ends much further from horizontal, the vertical impulse generated from the free limbs could be much greater. "],

["conclusion.html", "5 Conclusion", " 5 Conclusion Primary errors The analysis highlighted two primary errors: Forward lean Ineffective jump Interpretation and discussion The forward lean causes Jannick to loose excessive horizontal velocity during especially the step. The ineffective jump might well be caused by the forward lean. We were able to tell that he produces insufficient vertical velocity (and force) and that seems mainly caused by a lack of swinging of the free leg and probably arms. Swinging motions, especially by the arms, have a great effect on the vertical velocity produced at the cost of horizontal velocity [17]. However, in the jump this trade-off offers a good deal. Recommendations In conclusion, we recommend that the technical training focuses on upright posture and achieving greater height in the jump, mainly through improving the active free limb motions. "],
